                MASKS All guests must wear a mask at all times, and follow LA County's <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CC847NFlPUp/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link" target="_blank">Mask Etiquette</a> .<br />
                We have a strict, no mask, no service policy.
                If you forget your mask, don't worry, we have them for purchase for $2.
                Please note, you may be asked to adjust your face mask, or purchase one, to meet County requirements of proper face mask use.
                SOCIAL DISTANCE Check-in is now downstairs to enable 6ft distancing.<br />
                Additionally, occupancy has been reduced by half. Which means fewer people, and more one on one cat time!
                SANITIZE We are increasing our already strict sanitizing protocols to include sanitizing between guests visits.

            <p>The Cat Cafe is one of the few cat cafes to allow children to visit.
            Most cat cafes do not allow children to visit.
            In order to continue this, we need help from parents. Here’s what we ask you to do.</p>
            <h2>Actively Supervise Your Children</h2>
            <p>We’ve had parents bring their children in and immediately sit down and start texting or answering emails.
            Please know that we require parents to actively supervise their children.
            Active supervision means watching their children to make sure they’re interacting with the acts appropriately.</p>
            <h2>Be Sure Your Children Can Help Maintain A Calm Environment</h2>
            <p>We work hard to keep a calm and relaxed environment.
            It’s an environment where the cats can thrive and it’s also what customers expect.
            If your child would not be happy in this kind of an environment, please wait until they can before you bring them.
            That way, everyone, both two-legged and four-legged, can enjoy their time at The Cat Cafe.</p>
            <h2>Prepare Your Children to Listen to Directions</h2>
            <p>
                We understand that even when you are watching your children, sometimes, they will do things that you don’t want them to do. Make sure they are willing and able to comply with directions given to them by the staff or volunteers in the cat playpen.
                This is for their safety as well as the safety and well being of the animals.
            </p>
            <h2>Decision of Staff and Volunteers is Final</h2>
            <p>
                Upon entry, if the staff or volunteers feel that the actions of individual children will not contribute to the calm and relaxed environment we seek to maintain at The Cat Cafe, we will educate them on the need for this.
                If they cannot do this, we will decline your admission.
                If children enter the playpen and do not act in a way consistent with the environment we seek to maintain, we will inform them and you of this.
                Continuation of problematic behavior will mean the child must leave. The decision of volunteers and staff on this is final. No refunds will be given if children are required to leave due to their behavior.

            </p>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>We’ve had literally thousands of children come through and visit us, and we’ve only had to require a handful of them to leave. We’re happy that we’re one of the few cat cafes that allow children to visit! With the cooperation of their parents, we’ll be able to continue this policy.</p>
