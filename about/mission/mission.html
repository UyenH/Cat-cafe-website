                MASKS All guests must wear a mask at all times, and follow LA County's <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CC847NFlPUp/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link" target="_blank">Mask Etiquette</a> .<br />
                We have a strict, no mask, no service policy.
                If you forget your mask, don't worry, we have them for purchase for $2.
                Please note, you may be asked to adjust your face mask, or purchase one, to meet County requirements of proper face mask use.
                SOCIAL DISTANCE Check-in is now downstairs to enable 6ft distancing.<br />
                Additionally, occupancy has been reduced by half. Which means fewer people, and more one on one cat time!
                SANITIZE We are increasing our already strict sanitizing protocols to include sanitizing between guests visits.

                We rescue & find homes for homeless cats.
            </h2>
            <p>
                We partner with rescues who save homeless cats and kittens at risk of euthanasia in high kill shelters, and house them in our cafes.
                Once they are at our locations, we care for our cats & kittens until they are adopted! Our mission is to reduce euthanasia in animal shelters,
                and to improve the lives of homeless cats.

            <p>
                Cat Cafe's were made popular in Asia, but they don't actually adopt out the cats. In their concept, guests enjoy something to drink or eat while they play with cats.
                <br /><br />
                At CatCafe Lounge, ALL our cats are available for adoption (and cuddles)!

            <h2>Our Concept</h2>
            <p>
                From our onsite cafe guests can enjoy fresh brewed coffee to sip and a light snack to nibble, while lounging in a room full of adorable adoptable cats (35+) for 90 minutes.
                We formed as a nonprofit because contributions should support life-saving (period).
                We believe all cat lives matter and love sharing our kittos backgrounds, favorite toy, or adorable belly rub moments.

            <h2>Our Socialization</h2>
            <p>
                Cat Cafe's by nature help cats be social and open up to people.
            But we take SOCIALIZATION one step further.
                <b>
                    High-fives aside, roughly 5% of our population are undersocialized.
                    These are the type of cats that are going to be euthanized because
                </b> they "aren't adoptable".
            With the help of our resident volunteer and Feline Behaviorist, Cristin,
            identifies and aids the CatCafe Lounge team in rehabilitating these forgotten kittos so they can find a furever home. High-five to that!
